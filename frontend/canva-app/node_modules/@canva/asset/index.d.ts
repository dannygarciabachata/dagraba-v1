/**

 *

 * Helps users make informed decisions about the content they interact with.
 *
 * AI is generally defined as any machine system that, given an objective, infers how to generate an output from an input.
 * Some examples include "generative AI", "large language models", and "machine learning".
 *
 * **App Generated**
 *
 * 'app_generated' indicates when the app creates or significantly alters an asset using AI. Includes when
 * the app makes a request to a third-party service to do so.
 *
 * A significantly altered asset means the AI changes key information or details, such as
 * removing or replacing key components in the original content, which can include applying style transfer, or changing facial expressions.
 *
 * Label this asset as 'app_generated' under these conditions:
 *
 * The following is true:
 *
 * - The app generates the asset in response to a user's request (including past requests), for example, the asset is not from an asset library.
 *
 * And any of these conditions are also true:
 *
 *  - The AI creates entirely new content from scratch.
 *  - The AI introduces new multimedia, details, or creative elements not originally present.
 *  - The AI removes and replaces the asset's key components.
 *  - The AI alters the asset's appearance, meaning, or context in a way that conveys a different message than the original.
 *
 * **None**
 *
 * 'none' indicates when the asset wasn't generated by the app as a part of any user's specific request, for example, a third-party
 * request, or when the asset wasn't significantly altered by AI.
