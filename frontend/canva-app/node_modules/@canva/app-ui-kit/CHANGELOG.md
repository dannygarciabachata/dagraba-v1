# CHANGELOG

## 5.6.0 - 2026-02-19

### Changed

- Internal updates to css color token values, very minor visual regressions may appear.
- Updated the `colorUiOverlayBg` color token value to be slightly darker in dark mode.
- `Flyout` trigger has internal markup changes, removed an outer div wrapper from the `Flyout` component, no layout impact or regressions are expected.
- Flyout component internal behavior change, header content (title, description) now defaults to center alignment for mobile sheet view to align to the rest of Canva.
- Changes the line height of the `Title` component in size "large", from 32px to 30px on viewports <600px, and 42px to 40px on larger viewports. Visual changes are minor and affect whitespace only.
- Updated internal `Title` font weights for most `Title` sizes, large/medium/small titles from 700 to 600. No change required for consumers of the Title component, minimal visual shifts are expected affecting horizontal whitespace only.
- Added better viewport safe-area detection to pinned elements, like the `Flyout` or `FlyoutMenu`.

### Added

- Added a `HtmlPreview` component that can be used to display HTML in the `previewUi` of content publisher intent apps.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where the `Text` component font weight would behave differently than expected when when using a 'b' or 'strong' tag. They will now be 600 weight like the usual `bold` variant of that component.
- Fixed an issue with the `Carousel` and `Tabs` components would render incorrectly not follow the global ltr / rtl directions.
- Fixed an issue where the `PillsInput` remove button isn't being triggered when `maxRows` is set and content is scrollable.

## 5.5.0 - 2026-01-14

### Changed

- Reverted `Checkbox` component to use `box-shadow` spread animation for checked/indeterminate states. The previous `background-color` workaround was for an [iOS 26.1 Beta WebKit bug](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=300477) that has since been fixed in the stable release. No code changes required - this is a visual implementation detail.
- Made the `Flyout` component popover and sheet appearances have the same DOM structure on first paint.
- Updated CSS tokens used in various components. Expect very slight visual updates.

### Fixed

- Fixed the `Slider` component briefly flashing with the fill bar at 100% when first loading.
- Fixed the `Card` component fixed focus outline not visible on Safari.
- Fixed carousel items not properly applying item width when they have fluid content.

### Fixed

- Fixed `Carousel` snapping not working with virtualized items.
- Fixed a bug where the `Carousel` component would crash upon unmount.

## 5.3.0 - 2025-12-10

### Changed

- Updated `react` and `react-dom` peer dependencies to `^19.2.1`.
- `Carousel` component improvements:
  - Items that are not fully visible are now marked as `inert` by default. This means their elements and descendants won't be tabbable or interactive until they are fully visible. A new prop `outOfViewItemBehavior` has been added to opt out of this behavior.
  - Accessibility skip links have been disabled by default if the "inert" `outOfViewItemBehavior` is selected (or defaulted), otherwise become enabled if "none" behavior is selected.
  - Updated the scroll buttons to have smoother animations, and updated the buttons to have circle buttons.
  - Updated item visibility thresholds to improve stability and usability.
- Updated internal shadow colors, small variations in shadows can be expected.

### Added

- Introduced the `SurfaceHeader` component.
- Added a `trigger` prop to the `FlyoutMenu` component, enabling any React.ReactNode to be a FlyoutMenu trigger.
- Added a `variant` prop to the `LinkButton` component, supporting either `regular` (default) or `critical`.

### Fixed

### Added

### Fixed

- Fixed an [IOS 26.1 beta bug](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=300477), which broke the way the box-shadow was applied to `Checkbox` to cover the entire area. Replaced it with background color.
- Fixed a bug where one `AudioCard` component unmounting would stop all currently playing `AudioCard`s.

- Updated the colorControlBorderHovered semantic token to be correct in dark mode.

- **Breaking:** The `source` parameter of the `onChange` callback for the `ColorSelector` component is now optional. The migration is to check for undefined values in the callback handler.

- **Breaking:** Replaced `Pill` and `InputPill` `truncateText` prop with new `maxWidth` prop. The new prop better describes its functionality, and represents its size in a more explicit manner.
- **Breaking:** Changed the `size` property for the `Pill` component to be consistent with `Button` size variants. To retain the old "small" Pill size, use the new "xsmall" variant.

### Added

- Introduced a `wrapInset` prop for the `Badge` component, with a `-1u` value to improve the appearance and spacing of badges wrapped around icons.

      <CogIcon />
    </Badge>
  </Box>
  ```

**Note:** Canva's app submission process requires a single app bundle. Implementing localization might increase the size of the app and cause webpack to split the bundle into multiple chunks. If this happens, you can force webpack to emmit a single bundle [using the LimitChunkCountPlugin](https://www.canva.dev/docs/apps/localization/migrate-an-existing-app/#step-4-configure-webpack-chunk-limit):

In your `webpack.config.js`:

1. Add the `optimize` module to the `webpack` import:

```diff
- const { DefinePlugin } = require("webpack");
+ const { DefinePlugin, optimize } = require("webpack");
```

2. In the `plugins` add the chunk limit before buildDevConfig is called. Modify the plugins definition:

```diff
plugins: [
  new DefinePlugin({
    BACKEND_HOST: JSON.stringify(backendHost),
  }),
+ new optimize.LimitChunkCountPlugin({ maxChunks: 1 }),
],
```
